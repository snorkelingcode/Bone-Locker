- Should have minimal rotation on all axes (±15° maximum)
- Primary movement should be positional, not rotational

COMMON MOCAP ARTIFACTS TO PREVENT
==================================

1. Finger Hyperextension: Fingers bending backward beyond anatomical limits
2. Elbow/Knee Hyperextension: Joints bending in reverse direction
3. Excessive Spine Twist: Spine rotating beyond human capability
4. Impossible Shoulder Movement: Shoulders moving outside natural range
5. Wrist Overrotation: Wrists twisting beyond comfortable limits
6. Toe Overextension: Toes bending too far up or down
7. Neck Overrotation: Head turning beyond natural limits (±90°)
8. Hip Overextension: Legs moving backward beyond natural limits

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
======================

1. Chain Dependencies: Some bones should follow parent bone constraints
2. Mirrored Constraints: Left/Right bones should have identical constraints
3. Gender Differences: Some constraints may vary slightly for male/female rigs
4. Age Considerations: Older characters may have tighter constraints
5. Style Considerations: Cartoon vs realistic animations may have different limits

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
====================

- All constraints should be applied in Euler angles before converting to quaternions
- Small rotations (< 5°) should be eliminated to reduce jitter
- Constraints should be applied per-keyframe across the entire animation
- IK bones should have the strictest constraints
- Facial bones (if present) should have their own constraint set
- Weapon attachment points should maintain reasonable orientations
